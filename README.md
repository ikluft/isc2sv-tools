  - purpose: processes a Zoom webinar attendee report into CSV data with members' CPE points
  - description: This processes a Zoom webinar attendee report (in Comma Separated Values CSV format) into CSV data with members' earned Continuing Professional Education CPE points for the amount of time Zoom says they attended the meeting. I made this for monthly ISC² Silicon Valley Chapter meetings. This could be useful to other ISC² chapters, but not likely for any other purposes.
